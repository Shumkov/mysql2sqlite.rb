= mysql2sqlite.rb

== DESCRIPTION

A Ruby script for exporting MySQL databases to Sqlite databases.

== USAGE

Can be executed by either passing the database connection values directly:

    ./mysql2sqlite.rb database_name database_user database_password

or by passing it the path to a YAML-based configuration file:

    ./mysql2sqlite.rb config.yaml

== YAML CONFIG FILE

If you're familiar with Rails or Merb, this format will seem uncanny:

config:
  database: database_name
  username: database_username
  password: database_password

== KNOWN ISSUES

This is version 0.0. I suspect it is inefficient as all get-out and likely fails on some databases (in other words: currently, it works for me).
